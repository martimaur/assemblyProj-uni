# Asteroid Crasher
Asteroids game project in Assembly for university.

This was a group project with [@rodrigomfc](https://github.com/rodrigomfc), and as such, I simply forked the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the project.
2. Open the assembly simulator: `simulador-16-5-2023`.
3. Load the circuit `Grupo54.cir` (see screenshot below).

4. On the top-left menu, select `Simulation`.
5. The game is now playable. Use the keyboard to destroy the red asteroids and catch the green energy so the ship doesn't run out of energy! (see the screenshot below).
